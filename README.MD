The File Sorter project is a Python script designed to organize files in a specified directory based on their extensions and creation dates. 
Users can interactively select a directory containing files to be sorted. The project consists of two main components:

File_Sorter.py: This script performs the actual sorting of files in a given directory. It organizes files into folders based on their extensions and creation dates.

plotter.py: This script reads data from a data.json file, which contains information about the total size of moved files for each date.
It creates a line plot using Matplotlib, visualizing trends and patterns in the file sizes over time.
